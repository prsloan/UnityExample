##  Minecraft Example in unity

This is a quick and dirty example of a mincraft-like program using a vertex engine.
The World is dynamically generated around the player so the player can walk
infinitely.  

Additional features are collision detection, jumping, gravity, and a walking sound.
Also, blocks can be removed by pointing at the block and clicking.
